## Description
In our financial program my teammate and I are looking to solve problems such as companies, business owners and individuals who are not sure how to calculate their projected monthly savings that works for them by inputting their monthly income and expenses. The solutions that we are implementing in our financial tracking program are expense categorization, the ability to set financial goals and cash flow monitoring. 

## Objective
Our programs objectives are to monitor cash flow analysis, income tracking and the ability to set financial goals such as a monthly budget and savings based on the user’s income and expenses each month.

## Limitations
Some limitations of the program would be the reliance of the user input being that they choose the option first then press enter and then input the amount, as well as the user using “,”. Some recommendation on improving these limitations of the program regarding the reliance on user input accuracy, because the program will only read # inputs without “,” for example, instead of user inputting “1,000” user must input “1000”. 

## Future Enhancements
Future enhancements would include : Making the program easier to run, making the option of using commas "," when inputing an amount (ex 1,00). More options for chart visualizations.
