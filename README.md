# Financial-Program
In our financial program my teammate and I are looking to solve problems such as companies, business owners and individuals who are not sure how to calculate their projected monthly savings that works for them by inputting their monthly income and expenses.

The solutions that we are implementing in our financial tracking program are expense categorization, the ability to set financial goals and cash flow monitoring. Algorithm implementation is the process of translating a customized algorithm into a working a running piece of code within a specific programming language. Essentially, implementing the algorithm involves writing a code that will execute the steps you have designed.  Our programs objectives are to monitor cash flow analysis, income tracking and the ability to set financial goals such as a monthly budget and savings based on the userâ€™s income and expenses each month. 

Features:
Income Tracking : Input monthly income.
Expense Tracking : Add monthly expenses.
Savings Goals : Set a savings goal and calculate remaining savings.
Budget Summary : Generate a detailed summary of income, expenses, savings goals, and remaining savings.
File Output : Save the budget summary to a .txt file for future reference.
